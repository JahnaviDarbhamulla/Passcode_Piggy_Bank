# Passcode_Piggy_Bank
### I created "Passcode Piggy Bank" app that stores passwords instead of coins!

Recenty I came across this website called "Have I been Pawned ?". (link: https://haveibeenpwned.com/) 
Here you can find all your passwords that have been compromised . I then realised that people are very bad at keeping their passwords. This is because most of the time the passwords are qwerty, passcode, 12345 and so on .This makes it easier for the hackers to just try out your credentials in a few other apps and see if it works.

Here are some useful tips I came across for creating strong passwords and keeping your information secure.

* Use a unique password for each of your important accounts (i.e. email and online banking). Do not use the same password across multiple accounts.
* Your password should be at least 8 characters long. Password should consist of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers and symbols. A long password will offer more protection than a short password if it is properly constructed.
* Do not use personal information such as your name, age, date of birth, child’s name, pet’s name, or favorite color/song when constructing your password.
* Avoid consecutive keyboard combinations (i.e. qwerty or asdfg).
* Always select “never” when your Internet browser asks for your permission to remember your passwords.

Now let's be honest, it's not easy to remember and create unique passwords for every website and also its difficult to store them. People dont prefer using Internet based or third party services either to store their passwords and want to store it somewhere locally in their PC or laptop.

This is where passcode piggy bank comes in handy.

In this app you can store all your passwords in a textfile and store it in your personal vault.Every time you want to create a new password it gets added to the file.This app also helps you generate passwords.

### How to use this app :
1. Download the dist folder from this repository.
2. Once, you download the file, you will find two text files : personal.txt, piggy_bank.txt.
3. piggy_bank.txt file stores the password for the Passcode Piggy Bank app so enter the password you want for this app and save it.
4. data.txt file stores your name and all the passwords you enter.Change your name and save the file.
5. move the shortcut executable file (passcode_piggy_bank.py) to desktop or wherever you want and run it.

### Working:

### This is the home page where you enter the password you stored in your personal.txt file.
